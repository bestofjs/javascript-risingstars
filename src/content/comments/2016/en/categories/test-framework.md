The 2 most famous testing frameworks are {jasmine} and {mocha} but 2 more recent projects got more traction in 2016: {ava} and {jest}.

#### {ava}

{ava}, created by the prolific [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) puts emphasize on performance (parallel test) and ES6. AVA's syntax is close to standard test frameworks like {tape} and {node-tap}.

#### {jest}

{jest}, another Facebook project, got a lot of traction over the last weeks. It's well-known in the React community, more and more people are moving to Jest (read [this story](https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/migrating-to-jest-881f75366e7e#.z9x53j1ea) for example) and it may become the most popular testing framework in 2017.

Jest has good built-in mocking abilities, whereas other testing frameworks usually rely on libraries like {sinonjs}.
