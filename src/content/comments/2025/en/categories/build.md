Bun’s consistent effort paid off, leading the all-in-one JavaScript toolkit to the top spot. Throughout the year, it kept improving performance, [Node.js compatibility](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2#node-js-compatibility), and delivering many new useful features, making it [a great platform for full-stack JavaScript development](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3#full-stack-javascript-runtime). The year closed with Bun being acquired by Anthropic, we’re eager to see what 2026 brings for the project.

This year was also important for [void(0)](https://voidzero.dev/). The company [announced in late 2024](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-voidzero-inc) is behind a new generation of frontend infrastructure tooling (Oxc, Rolldown) and already gave us a glimpse of the future. Its flagship project Vite continued to improve throughout the year, stabilizing the new [Environment API](https://main.vite.dev/guide/api-environment), and making it possible to use the [new Rust-based bundler Rolldown](https://vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite8-beta). The project even received its own [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWQqAKLgT4). Vitest also released one of its most anticipated features: [Browser Mode](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-vitest-4). New exciting projects are emerging from the Oxc ecosystem as very compelling alternatives to existing tools: [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/blog/2025-06-10-oxlint-stable.html) could become the new ESLint, and [Oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/blog/2025-12-01-oxfmt-alpha.html) the new Prettier. The company ended the year by [raising a new Series A](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-series-a) and announcing [Vite+](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-vite-plus), its first commercial offering.

It’s also worth mentioning {rspack}. This Rust-based bundler from ByteDance is a faster, drop-in alternative to webpack, so it’s no surprise to see it being [widely adopted this year](https://npmtrends.com/@rspack/core). The broader Rstack ecosystem is worth watching, spawning new tools like [Rstest](https://rstest.rs/) and [Rslint](https://rslint.org/).

Next.js recently [switched to Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16#turbopack-stable) as the new default bundler, bringing major speed gains over its former bundler webpack. Note that it’s also possible to [build Next.js apps with Rspack](https://rspack.rs/blog/rspack-next-partner).

Although not yet ready for prime time, one of the most important announcements of the year is [Microsoft rewriting TypeScript in Go](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/), making it significantly faster. The team has recently [shared progress](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/progress-on-typescript-7-december-2025/), and the native TypeScript experience already looks ready for early adopters. TypeScript 6.0 will be the last JavaScript-based release, serving as a bridge to TypeScript 7.0—the Go rewrite.
In 2025, modern infrastructure tools increasingly originated from large or VC-backed companies, raising an important question: can established, community-driven projects stay competitive in the year ahead?
