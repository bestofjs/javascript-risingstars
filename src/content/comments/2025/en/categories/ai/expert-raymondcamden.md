## About Chrome AI and Transformers

This is just a placeholder for now. Raymond will provide more content here soon.

A few weeks ago I blogged a demo where I used Chrome's on-device AI feature to parse a "generic template language" and return random strings. If you're so inclined (and of course you are), you can read that post here: "Creating a Generic Generative Language with Chrome AI". The idea was to give the AI model a template string that described what was random, and how it was random (this is a name, this is a number, this is a color, etc) and have the model fill in the blanks with appropriate values.
