#### Newcomers

For the first time in the decade-long history of JavaScript Rising Stars, neither React Native nor its primary meta-framework, {expo}, are to be found at the top of the Mobile section. Instead, both have been supplanted by two newcomers, {valdi} and {lynx} – the respective in-house frameworks of Snap (the company behind Snapchat) and ByteDance (the company behind Tiktok).

{valdi} and {lynx} will not look alien to React Native developers. They are both web-inspired, rendering native views yet supporting TypeScript, JSX, flexbox layout, hot reload, and CSS. Valdi components look [reminiscent](https://github.com/Snapchat/Valdi/blob/main/docs/docs/core-component.md) of React class components, while Lynx supports both an imperative API and a full-blown [React abstraction](https://lynxjs.org/guide/start/quick-start?ios-simulator-platform=macos-arm64&explorer-platform=ios-simulator) (which it recommends by default).

Where they distinguish themselves is in the business requirements that they optimise for. Valdi was designed to be lightweight, lazy-loaded, and scalable, to enable [opt-in adoption](https://github.com/Snapchat/Valdi/blob/main/docs/docs/faq.md#why-did-snap-create-this) on a screen-by-screen basis without significant performance cost. Lynx was designed to afford rich interactivity, employing a [dual-thread architecture](https://lynxjs.org/next/blog/lynx-unlock-native-for-more#use-the-main-thread-responsibly-for-interactivity) to offer a web-like abstraction without bottlenecking on a single thread.

But they're not the only newcomers to dethrone React Native. {dioxus}, in fourth place, is an ambitious framework, which aims to deliver a "[better Flutter](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.7/#what-is-dioxus)" based on web technologies, but without the weight of a fully-featured web view. While for now it does default to using system web views, the long-term goal is to stabilise [Blitz](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz), their lightweight web renderer that draws using native graphics APIs (e.g. Vulcan and Metal) via [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu). At present, Dioxus apps are scripted exclusively in Rust, but there are plans to support more languages in future.

#### Incumbents

On to the incumbents, which need no introduction. React Native shows another stellar performance for the year, with increased strides towards the long-awaited version 1. It **improved web conformance** in [0.77](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/01/21/version-0.77); it introduced support for **React 19** in version [0.78](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/02/19/react-native-0.78); it began moving towards a **stable JavaScript API** and **strict TypeScript API** from [0.80](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/06/12/moving-towards-a-stable-javascript-api); it introduced **prebuilt iOS binaries** ([paving the way](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/587#issuecomment-3200592526) to **migrate from CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager**) in [0.81](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/08/12/react-native-0.81); it dropped Old Architecture and added opt-in support for **Hermes V1** in [0.82](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/10/08/react-native-0.82); and it shipped the **first ever non-breaking release** in [0.83](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/12/10/react-native-0.83). With such inexorable velocity, and the long-term assurances brought by the formation of the [React Foundation](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/07/introducing-the-react-foundation) this year, React Native continues to be a sure bet in any cross-platform tech stack.

<!-- MORE -->

{expo}, of course, enjoys all these improvements. This year, it shipped [SDK 53](https://expo.dev/changelog/sdk-53) and [SDK 54](https://expo.dev/changelog/sdk-54) (with too many features to mention). It created [EAS Workflows](https://expo.dev/services/workflows) to streamline every part of the app development and distribution process; it introduced [build cache providers](https://expo.dev/blog/build-cache-providers-in-expo) to reduce CI times; it released [Expo UI](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v53.0.0/sdk/ui/) to enable fully native (and Liquid Glass-ready) interfaces; and developed [Expo Launch](https://expo.dev/blog/introducing-expo-launch) to help get apps into the App Store faster than ever before. Nowadays, Expo is used in [thousands](https://evanbacon.dev/blog/expo-apps) of chart-topping apps, and has proved a popular framework for vibe coders, with Evan Bacon's [live demo](https://www.youtube.com/live/p9OcztRyDl0?t=21364s) at React Conf 2025 showing the possibilities.

{capacitor} holds its spot in the top ten as ever, shipping versions [7](https://ionic.io/blog/capacitor-7-has-hit-ga) and [8](https://ionic.io/blog/announcing-capacitor-8), each focusing on maintenance updates – namely, transitioning to Swift Package Manager and adding support for Android Edge-to-Edge. While a comparatively quiet year in terms of updates, it shows a continued appetite to build mobile apps with web views.

The rest of the incumbents are all component and styling frameworks for React Native. {react-native-reusables} enjoys its second straight year at the top of this heap, with {gluestack-ui} and {Nativewind} both leapfrogging {tamagui}. This healthy competition shows that UI is by no means a solved problem yet in React Native. These options allow you to optimise for your requirements, depending on which you value out of interop with the web, SSR support, runtime performance, composability, themeability, accessibility, and more.

#### What does it all mean?

Putting it all together, React Native continues to grow in popularity and keep up a high development velocity even after a decade of usage, while Expo sits proudly (and deservedly) as the primary entrypoint into its ecosystem. For the first time, React Native receives compelling new competition from three fronts in one year – but these needn't be taken as existential threats. Lynx, for example, has been warmly welcomed to conferences alongside React Native this year, with evocative ideas such as [dual-threaded React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uUcYrl51JM) stoking healthy discussion on how the two could co-evolve.

The overarching pattern I see in these results is a resounding love for the web. New and old, all these top mobile frameworks draw from the idioms of the web platform. Developers simply _love_ web technologies. They're so productive and ergonomic that we can't help but drag them with us from ecosystem to ecosystem, no matter the mountains that need be moved to do so.

I also see opportunity. Valdi and Lynx turned a lot of heads this year – are any other Big Tech companies sitting on in-house frameworks yet to be revealed? And look at all these competing UI frameworks for React Native – it seems like any fresh idea could still capture users and there is still everything to play for in this space.

So what do I expect for 2026? I think that while mobile frameworks are already plenty mature on many fronts, they're still very far behind the web platform in terms of developer experience, and so there will be natural momentum towards closing this gap. Doing so will require speeding up builds, smoothing out the deployment process, making it easier to create advanced UIs, and reducing friction between abstraction layers. We've seen a lot of activity towards all of these points this year for sure, but I believe there are still many low-hanging fruit going unpicked, so can't wait to see what the next harvest brings.
