The first 4 projects are the same as in 2024, besides Hono and Astro swapping positions.

Like last year, {payload}, a headless CMS that installs directly into any Next.js app, is the hottest project of the year. The biggest news is the [acquisition by Figma](https://payloadcms.com/posts/blog/payload-is-joining-figma), the ultimate goal being to lower the gap between design and code.

At #2, Next.js 16 introduced the [cached components](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16#cache-components) to make caching more explicit and flexible. Developers can create static page shells that include dynamic content streaming from the server.

At #3, {astro} keeps shining as a versatile framework to build content-heavy applications (like your beloved JS Rising Stars!) with a great developer experience and a focus on performance.

At #4, {hono} became a standard for web servers (even if {express} is still ranked 15th!), thanks to its lightweight core that runs anywhere (Node.js runtimes, Cloudflare workers...) and a rich eco-system of handlers and middlewares. Read about [the story of Hono](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-story-of-web-framework-hono-from-the-creator-of-hono/).

The biggest change in the category of the meta frameworks is the rise of [Tanstack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest), as one of the best alternatives to Next.js if you want to build a full-stack application on top of React.
