#### Overall winner: {n8n} 🏆

{n8n} is the absolute winner of the 2025 rankings, and the numbers are insane: +112,000 stars in a single year. No project has received that amount of stars in a single year since we started running the Rising Stars.

n8n is a fair-code workflow automation platform with native AI capabilities that allows you to connect various apps and services through visual workflows. Its success reflects the growing need for no-code automation tools, now enhanced with AI integrations to support emerging agent-based workflows.

In the workflow automation space, you may be interested in the following two projects created in 2025:

- {motia} (number 17 overall)
- [workflow](https://useworkflow.dev/)

Three other projects related to AI make the TOP 10:

- {onlook}: brings AI-first visual editing to React apps
- {dyad}: a free, local, open-source AI app builder and v0/lovable/Bolt alternative
- {stagehand}: brings AI-powered browser automation

#### Number 2: shadcn-ui

At #2, {shadcnui}, our champion of 2023 and 2024, keeps its tremendous momentum.

If you have checked our previous editions, you already know it's a set of consistent React components crafted with taste and great attention to details (accessibility, keyboard interactions, etc.), gathering the best of headless components such as Radix UI, TanStack Table...

It's also a registry that has made a new mode of distributing components possible.
A lot of projects define themselves as "shadcn/ui" projects, and about 100 projects are listed in the official [Registry Directory](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/directory).

The most amazing feature of shadcn/ui is that it found the sweet spot between functionality available out of the box and customizability.

Beyond the newly added components, shadcn/ui is no longer tightly coupled to Radix UI and now supports [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/) (number 4 in the component libraries rankings)

There was a criticism that sites built with it tend to look similar; however, the ability to customize the look-and-feel has improved a lot with the introduction of new styles and a new [create page](https://ui.shadcn.com/create) to build your own custom theme.

#### Number 3: react-bits

{react-bits} is a collection of fancy animated components (background effects, text animations, cards...) for React, perfect for building memorable websites.

Interestingly, it's distributed as a shadcn/ui project, available from the shadcn/ui registry using the command line or via good old copy-paste in your codebase. Some of the components require a dependency: either [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) or [motion](https://motion.dev/).

The documentation comes with a [Background Studio](https://reactbits.dev/tools/background-studio) that lets you adjust and customize the setup of all components (colors, speed, number of particles...) and export as a snippet you can copy-paste in your codebase.

Also available as a Vue version: {vue-bits}.

#### Special Pick

At number 7, {better-auth} is a great solution to handle authentication in your application using your own infrastructure. It comes with a system of plugins to address the most common needs: magic links, one-time passwords, multi-tenant architecture to support organizations with members and roles, and many more.

It's framework-agnostic and can be used with any framework, but it comes with great integrations for all major fullstack frameworks.
