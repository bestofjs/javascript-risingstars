**2025 Was the Year of the Workflow and 2026 Will Be the Year You Can't Ignore It**

The chatbot era is over. The tools surging in developer mindshare aren't chatbot libraries or prompt playgrounds, they're workflow engines. {n8n}'s is blowing the doors off the charts with an +111k star jump in 2025. Which is not surprising, n8n is becoming the go to tool for connecting frontier models to tools creating to build those agents. {dyad}, {flowise}, {mastra}, {stagehand}, is a whose who of automation and agentic workflows. Vercel is still the go to for folks who want to take control of the chat and the agentic flow at the base level (but they are also adding agents). [TanStack AI](https://github.com/TanStack/ai) is the new kid on the block, but they are making waves with their agentic capabilities.

So here's your 2026 homework: stop asking "how do I get better responses from my LLM" and start asking "what workflows can I hand off entirely to AI?" Pick up n8n or {flowise} and build something that triggers on an event, reasons through options, and takes action without asking permission. Wire up a {mastra} agent that coordinates across multiple tools and platforms. Experiment with {stagehand} to automate browser tasks.

Chatbot's were just the training wheels. Time to take them off.

Oh, also, pay attention to the dark horse of ["code mode"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/). It could be the biggest thing in this space since MCP.
