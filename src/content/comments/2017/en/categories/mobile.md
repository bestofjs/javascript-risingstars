JavaScript is so versatile that it can also be used to build mobile applications, meaning that you can share components between the web and the mobile platforms.

In this category, we find again the 3 main actors of the "Front-end frameworks":

* React with {react-native}
* Vue with {weex} and {quasar}
* Angular with {ionic} and {nativescript}

Like in 2016, {react-native} is the trendiest solution, based on JavaScript, to build a native application, whether it's for iOS, Android or Windows systems.

As highlighted in this video [Cross platform apps with React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cI-978DHaA), the promise: "Write Once, Run Everywhere" was fulfilled!
