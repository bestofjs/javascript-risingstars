Static site generators (or "SSG") are tools that generate a bunch of .html, .css and JavaScript files that you can deploy on any web server without the fuss of setting up a database.
Static web sites are fast, robust and easy to maintain.

Number 2 in 2016, {gatsby} gets revenge in 2017. It comes with a lot of great features to optimize your static site:

* Fast browsing & exporting
* Aggressive preloading
* Intelligent code splitting (templates + page data)

{gatsby} uses {react} as the view layer and GraphQL to query the content at the building time.
It has a strong community and [React official web site](https://reactjs.org) itself is built with Gatsby.

{react-static} is the newcomer in this category.
It aims to be a lighter alternative to {gatsby}, with a focus on performance and simplicity, inspired by {create-react-app} project.

It's worth to mention that both {nextjs} and {nuxt} projects can also be used as Static Site Generators.
