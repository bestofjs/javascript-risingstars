Let's recap some of the stories and dramas of 2023:

- Svelte code base ditching TypeScript files (while preserving type safety)
- Controversies around React (either too old, too complicated, PHP-like...)
- The fall of Rome and the rise of Biome
- Angular rejuvenated
- The release of Bun v1
- Astro 4.0 released
- Stylex open-sourced by Meta, at last!

We saw the rise of AI tools that can generate UI from prompts and even images making people wonder if there will be frontend developers in a few years.

As I pen down this summary for the eighth time, one can't help but wonder: Could an AI take over this task next year? 

If you enjoyed this roundup, share your appreciation, and who knows, we might be back in a year for the 2024 Rising Stars!
