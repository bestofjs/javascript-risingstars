With [Vue 2](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-2-eol) announced to sunset at the end of 2023, this year was deemed to be a turning point for Vue and its community with lots of us embarking on the journey to upgrade to version 3.

In that regard, efforts were made to help with migrating, the ecosystem caught up and kept on developing itself: it showed great results! [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) now has more downloads than Nuxt 2. UI frameworks, like [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) and [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/), are readier than ever to help build large (and less large!) applications. Libraries such as [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/), [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/), or even [TresJS](https://tresjs.org/) kept on growing and enhancing themselves to better empower us all.

Like in 2022, the Developer Experience was still was still a top priority. [Vue 3.3](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-3) brought in improved TypeScript support for `<script setup>`. Nuxt released 8 minor versions and unveiled [Nuxt DevTools](https://devtools.nuxt.com/), a creative and insightful UI to help us better understand our apps and develop them faster.

Looking forward, and as Evan said, 2024 is set to be an exciting year for Vue. Vue 3.4 is right around the corner and [Vapor mode](https://github.com/vuejs/core-vapor), now open-sourced, is progressing well. All of it tuning the new year for more performance improvements and community innovation.
