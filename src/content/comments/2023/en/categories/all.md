#### Overall winner: shadcn/ui 🏆

The hottest project of the year is shadcn/ui, a collection of UI components written in React, allowing customizable styling through TailwindCSS.

Built on top of {radix}, a set of headless components providing primitives for concerns like accessibility and keyboard interactions, shadcn/ui distinguishes itself from other popular libraries (such as MUI, ChakraUI, React Spectrum) by not being a downloadable NPM package. Instead, you integrate the shadcn/ui components through a terminal command that installs the underlying dependencies and copies the component source code directly into your codebase for further modification.

The project's success is closely tied to the widespread popularity of {tailwind-css} (number 20 overall), its compatibility with React Server Components, and the presence of excellent documentation.

It seems all new shiny React projects have adopted shadcn/ui. It was even chosen by Kent C. Dodds for his cutting-edge [Epic Stack](https://www.epicweb.dev/epic-stack).

Another example involving AI: from a user prompt describing the features and the look-and-feel of a piece of UI, the application [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) generates the JSX code made of shadcn/ui components. Mesmerizing!

Last but not least, [Best of JS](https://bestofjs.org) uses them too, after the rewrite I did to transition from a SPA to a Next.js app.

Its approach has already inspired other projects:

- [shad-cn/svelte](https://shadcn-svelte.com/) is the port for Svelte framework.
- [Draft UI](https://github.com/IHIutch/draft-ui) is built on top of [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) instead of Radix.

#### Number two: Bun

Bun, the champion of 2022, keeps its tremendous momentum.

Bun aims to be a fast, all-in-one toolkit for running, building, testing, and debugging JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

The [version 1](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.0) was officially released in September (check the peak in the graph!) and Bun claims to be "production-ready".

The docs provide great recipes to help get started as fast as possible with Bun APIs and common tasks such as file manipulation and handling database interactions.

A [strong statement](https://twitter.com/bunjavascript/status/1732945030007099510) was made at the end of the year:

> We have one goal for 2024
> Flip the default backend JavaScript runtime from Node.js to Bun

The compatibility with most of the Node.js eco-system (including the support of good old CommonJS imports via `require`) and the support of the main full-stack frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt, Astro...) can make it possible!
