{bun} is also a [bundler](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler) so we included it this year in the "Building Tools" category.

At two {vite} is still the most popular versatile bundler, powering meta frameworks such as Astro, Nuxt, Remix, SolidStart, SvelteKit...

The [version 5](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite5) released in November, is built on top of {rollup} 4, bringing performance improvements.

Evan You [announced](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1709943106215530867) he was working on Rolldown a port of Rollup in Rust that will be integrated to Vite. So the future of Vite is bright!

At three, the rise of {biome} is one of the stories of the year. It's related to the [fall of Rome](https://bytes.dev/archives/175), an ambitious project that aimed to unify the tooling (compiling, linting, formatting, bundling, testing). The company behind the project failed and the project was stopped this year.

Fortunately the project was forked and re-born under the name of Biome.

In November, Biome won the [Prettier Challenge](https://biomejs.dev/blog/biome-wins-prettier-challenge/): creating "a Rust-powered code formatter that could pass over 95% of Prettierâ€™s tests". Prettier being such a standard, we can expect more adoption of Biome in 2024.

Speaking of Rust, {oxc} and {rspack} are the new players in this space, coming from the ByteDance team.
{rspack} provides compatibility with Webpack while delivering unmatched performance. For the first time since we run the Rising Stars, it's weird not to see Webpack in the rankings given the number of projects that use it!
