In 2023, the mobile space made significant progress towards unifying the web and native development experiences. This is evident from the top projects Expo (#1), Tamagui (#3), and Nativewind (#6) which share the goal of maximizing code reuse and increasing accessibility for web developers.

There's a clear trend toward better styling solutions in React Native with Tamagui (#3), Nativewind (#6), and React Native Paper (#7) leading the way. This mirrors the web community, where shadcn-ui ranked #1 in overall popularity. I doubt this movement will slow down in 2024.

In 2022, the official recommendation from the React team shifted from boilerplate solutions like Create React App to framework-first solutions like Remix and Next.js. A year later, we can see a similar shift in the React Native ecosystem. Tools like Expo, Tamagui, and Ignite, which offer many framework-first attributes, have all trended upward in popularity. This shift indicates a move away from framework-less React Native towards more opinionated solutions by default, signaling the evolution of mobile development paradigms. I predict this trend will continue in 2024.

React Native's dominance is evident with seven of the top ten projects based on this library. However, the presence of three webview-based projects in this list suggests a lingering interest in deploying websites directly to app stores as-is. Perhaps 2024 will be the year that we see these two approaches start to converge.

Overall it was a fantastic year for mobile development. I predict 2024 will have continued interest in styling solutions for React Native, more rendering patterns for native (likely with React Server Components on native), better server integration to support AI-driven apps, and possibly some interesting visionOS projects.
