React 18 should be released very soon but it's already possible to play with the [RC version](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/9) and benefit from some out-of-the-box improvements such as [Automatic batching for fewer renders](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/21) or [SSR support for Suspense](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/22).

React 18 adds the long-awaited concurrent renderer and updates to [Suspense](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/47#discussioncomment-847004) without any major breaking changes. Some concurrent features such as [startTransition](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/41) will be available in the 18.0 initial release, but we'll have to wait a bit more to get the [Server Components](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html) mentioned in the [previous edition](https://risingstars.js.org/2020/en#section-react) of _JavaScript Rising Stars_.

React continues to progress both in the browser and the server, and with [React Native's many-platform vision](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/08/26/many-platform-vision), it is becoming more and more ubiquitous.
