In 2019, {svelte} disrupted the category of the UI frameworks, taking the 3rd position behind {vuejs} and {react} but before {angular}.

Does it mean that we have now a BIG-4 instead of a BIG-3?

Svelte is very different that the other frameworks because it's not really a framework but a compiler that runs its magic at building time, not at run time.

Like React or Vue, it lets developers build applications by creating components that update when data changes but the big difference is that the framework does not run in the browser, it runs at the building time.

The compiler is able to generate imperative code that manipulates the DOM directly from the components written by the developer.

Therefore the code shipped to the browser is both small and very fast to run (making Svelte applications suitable for embedded devices for example).

Besides its top notch performance, itâ€™s easy to create complex transitions that run in CSS.

The version 3 improves the concept of reactivity: updating a variable is all you need to trigger a change in the UI.

It's too early to state that Svelte will be as successful as the 3 other frameworks but it's worth following in 2020.
