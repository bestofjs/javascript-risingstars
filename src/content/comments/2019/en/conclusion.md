Among the interesting trends in the front-end side: will Svelte framework keep growing?

Or will we see more adoption of web standards such as web components?

One of the most interesting stories of 2019 was the fact that [Apple released its music web client](https://dev.to/ionic/apple-just-shipped-web-components-to-production-and-you-probably-missed-it-57pf) that uses Web components, compiled with {stencil}, one of the top UI frameworks of the year.
This is a "real world" usage of Web Components!

The fact that you can ship an [application that uses native modules](https://philipwalton.com/articles/using-native-javascript-modules-in-production-today/), is also a big improvement.

On the back-end side, Node.js turned 10 years in 2019 but new features keep being added at a fast pace.

As of v13.2.0, Node.js supports ES modules out of the box and can import Web Assembly modules. The Workers Threads API enables heavy computing operations.

So whether we talk about the browser or Node.js, the platform keeps evolving and this is what makes JavaScript development so exciting.

Thank you for your attention and see you next year!
