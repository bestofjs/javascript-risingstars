The top 5 Angular projects remain mostly the same as last year, apart from a new contender at number 3.

{scully} is a static site generator which brings Angular to the Jamstack. The project was launched in December 2019 and has great [documentation](https://scully.io/docs/learn/overview/) to help you get started.

Angular had three major releases in 2020.

[Version 9](https://blog.angular.io/version-9-of-angular-now-available-project-ivy-has-arrived-23c97b63cfa3) was released in February. The main change was moving to the Ivy compiler which brought smaller bundle sizes and many other build improvements. [Version 10](https://blog.angular.io/version-10-of-angular-now-available-78960babd41) and [11](https://blog.angular.io/version-11-of-angular-now-available-74721b7952f7) came out later in the year.

A significant focus for the Angular team in the second half of the year was to listen to the community. The team made a big effort to triage issues and PRs to understand and address the needs of the community. They also released a [roadmap](https://angular.io/guide/roadmap) to share what the team is working on and what they have planned for the future.
