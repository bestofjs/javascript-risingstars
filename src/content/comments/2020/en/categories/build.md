2020 was a great year for build tools, we have seen many new trends.

{snowpack} and {vite} bet on the future with an ES modules first approach: they do not bundle your code in dev, have extremely fast feedback loops, and fallback to bundling only for production (until browser support increase).

{swc} and {esbuild} leverage Rust and Go to have incredible performances, both supporting TypeScript.

{webpack} is often described as too complex, and simpler alternatives like {parcel} and {rollup} have matured. Webpack remains the de-facto build tool and its new caching layer could significantly improve your build performance.

Monorepos are becoming mainstream: Yarn and Lerna are widely used, and npm 7 joined the party.
