We have 2 types of projects that dominate the _Node.js Frameworks_ category.

On one hand, full-stack frameworks like {nextjs} and {nuxt} are both opinionated about how to build your application as they bring React and Vue.js to the server-side.

On the other hand, we have more classic options that run only in the server like {nest} (the leader last year) or {fastify}.

Like in 2018, the category is led by {nextjs}. In the beginning, it was made famous as a solution to render React applications on the server. Now it's the leading solution to build full-stack web applications with React.

The latest version provides features such as [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration) that brings the best of the dynamic and static worlds, making it a great fit for a lot of use cases.

About the full-stack frameworks, {blitz} and {redwood} are the 2 new contenders that aim to provide the best developer experience to build complete web applications.

It's interesting to see that {express}, born 11 years ago is still relevant in the JavaScript landscape.
