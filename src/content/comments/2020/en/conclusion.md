It was another great year in the JavaScript landscape with several new leaders in the different categories tracked by _Best of JS_.

Backend developers can have fun with {deno} and start hacking with TypeScript right away without having to worry about dependencies.

Frontend developers now have faster and simpler build tools with solutions such as {esbuild}, {snowpack} and {vite}.

Speaking of tooling, [version 7](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/631877012766785536/release-v700) of NPM provides [workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to handle several packages in a single repository, it was one of the big benefits provided by its rival [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

For styling, a solution like {tailwind-css} also comes from the same direction, providing more simplicity and it's building an ecosystem around a simple concept.

What to expect for 2021?

It will be interesting to see what comes of the React Server Components.

Now that Sebastian McKenzie is [working full-time on Rome](https://rome.tools/funding/), how far will it go in its attempt to unify JavaScript tooling. Could it be the single dependency to handle compiling, testing, linting... everything?

We'd keep an eye on the fullstack framework {redwood} project too, that plays well with GraphQL and has a unique way to handle data fetching using what they call "cells".

Don't forget to check the results from the amazing [State of JS](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/) survey if you want an other point of view over the trends, based on real user's feedback.

Thank you for your interest, and see you next year!
