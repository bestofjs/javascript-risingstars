The GraphQL ecosystem is picking up speed, and a big trend is the appearance of tools that simplify part of the process of setting up a GraphQL endpoint.

{gatsby} is still number one, and it's definitely one of the tools that make getting started with GraphQL the most approachable.

Graphcool evolved into {prisma} at number two, while {hasura-graphql-engine} also helps you generate a working back-end straight from your database. 

And the rest of the top 15 is filled out by GraphQL servers, clients, and various other utilities such as GraphQL Playground.
