In the battlefield of the front-end framework category, the 3 dominant actors were the same than in 2017: {vuejs}, {react} and {angular}.

If you check the graph, you may notice a peak of stars in June for both Vue.js and React. The reason? It was the time Vue.js passed React in terms of total number of stars, becoming the most popular project in the UI frameworks category. At that time, fans from both sides did their best to push their champion!

The newcomer in 2018 is {omi}, a very promising UI framework that takes advantage of the [Shadow DOM](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom) technology, while using the "JSX" syntax, familiar to React developers.
