2024 was full of exciting releases:

- [JSR: a new package registry](https://deno.com/blog/jsr-is-not-another-package-manager) from the Deno team that supports TypeScript natively.
- [Deno v2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0): an important milestone for the JS runtime, focused on using _Deno at scale_, including interoperability with legacy JS infrastructure, the ability to import any NPM package, and a stable Standard Library. Deno is also a package manager with its own caching mechanism to provide lightning-fast installs.
- [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest): it started as a boilerplate built around [TanStack router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) and morphed into a server-bound framework all of its own!
- [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/blog/tauri-20/) comes with a better developer experience (DX), a new plugin system, and mobile support.
- [Astro 5](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5/): the web framework for building content-driven websites, praised for its amazing DX. It introduces a new **content layer** to fetch content from any source in a flexible and type-safe way.
- The new company [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-voidzero-inc), dedicated to a high-performance and unified dev toolchain for the JS ecosystem.
- [Vite 6](https://vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite6.html) with the new [Environment API](https://green.sapphi.red/blog/increasing-vites-potential-with-the-environment-api) that opens new possibilities to expand beyond the browser.
- [TailwindCSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-beta) provides CSS-first configuration and better performance.
