2024 was full of exciting releases:

- [JSR: a new package registry](https://deno.com/blog/jsr-is-not-another-package-manager) from the Deno team that supports TypeScript natively.
- [Deno v2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0): an important milestone for the JS runtime, focused on using _Deno at scale_, including interoperability with legacy JS infrastructure, the ability to import any NPM package, and a stable Standard Library. Deno is also a package manager with its own caching mechanism to provide lightning-fast installs.
- [Bun v1.1](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.1) now supports Windows.
- [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest): it started as a boilerplate built around [TanStack router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) and morphed into a server-bound framework all of its own!
- [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/blog/tauri-20/) comes with a better developer experience (DX), a new plugin system, and mobile support.
- [Astro 5](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5/): the web framework for building content-driven websites, praised for its amazing DX. It introduces a new **content layer** to fetch content from any source in a flexible and type-safe way.
- The new company [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/posts/announcing-voidzero-inc), dedicated to a high-performance and unified dev toolchain for the JS ecosystem.
- [Vite 6](https://vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite6.html) with the new [Environment API](https://green.sapphi.red/blog/increasing-vites-potential-with-the-environment-api) that opens new possibilities to expand beyond the browser.
- [TailwindCSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-beta) provides CSS-first configuration and better performance.
- [React Router v7](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v7) brings back to the library features and improvements coming from Remix. The merger between projects is made clear by the docs that mention two ways to start, using either the library or the full framework.

One of the biggest news items came at the very end of the year: [Node.js 23 supports TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/typescript-is-coming-to-node-23) without the need for an experimental flag.

However, the most significant changes are not related to the libraries or frameworks we use to write code. Instead, they revolve around the incredible tools powered by AI. IDEs like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and services such as {bolt}, [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/), [Replit](https://replit.com/), and [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) can generate and even deploy full-stack applications with just a few prompts. If you can say it, you can build it! In 2025, competition in this field will skyrocket, and developers will need to adapt to leverage these powerful tools to their fullest potential.
