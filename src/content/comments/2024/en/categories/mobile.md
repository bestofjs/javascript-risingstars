In 2024, React Native continues to dominate the mobile app space, maintaining its status as the most popular framework for building cross-platform applications. Expo, for the second consecutive year, remains the top-ranked project, growing substantially since 2023.

One of the biggest trends this year is the growing emphasis on web/universal support in React Native. Expo Router has made substantial progress in bridging the web-native gap, introducing Expo DOM components ('use dom') to enable incremental migration between React web and universal React. This can also be observed in Meta's shift away from [React Native for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) towards the more web-focused {react-strict-dom} and {StyleX} which they're using internally. Further the majority of the top trending projects are focused on web/native unification.

Styling is still a key focus in the ecosystem. This can especially be observed with [Yoga v3](https://www.yogalayout.dev/blog/announcing-yoga-3.0) (React Native styling engine) which has brought a number of enhancements to built-in React Native styles, primarily driven by Meta's work on first-party apps like Instagram and Facebook for Quest (built with React Android). Meanwhile, community-driven solutions continue to thrive, with multiple approaches and opinions all generally bringing the best parts of the web over to native.

Looking ahead, I expect AI to play an even larger role in native development tooling and application experiences. Expo Router's early preview of universal React Server Components will likely inspire new composable server libraries to emerge. Additionally, native UIs will likely evolve even further, with more bindings into SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose, overall widening the 'pit of success'.

I also predict that the native community will grow even larger with the introduction of Expo DOM components and continued improvements to single-command app deployment tools like ([EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/)), making it a much more familiar and exciting space for all developers.

2025 will definitely be an exciting year!
