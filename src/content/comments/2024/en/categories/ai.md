AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are significantly transforming how developers work, revolutionizing both frontend and backend development.

Number one this year, **{n8n}** is a no-code automation platform that has been around for a while but saw a surge in popularity due to its AI capabilities, enabling developers to build AI features with models running locally. It’s part of [a starter kit](https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit) that quickly sets up a local AI environment with Docker.

At two, **{Flowise}** is another automation tool, built on top of LangChain, that specializes in creating workflows with local LLMs. Building workflows is as simple as picking one of the available building blocks and connecting inputs and outputs through the UI.

At three, **{bolt}** is an amazing tool that can build full-stack applications using any framework (Next.js, Remix, Astro, Nuxt, etc.) and deploy them (using **{supabase}**) in record time, all from a single prompt.

At four, **{transformersjs}** is a JavaScript library that brings state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models, like those from Hugging Face, directly to the browser and Node.js. It enables developers to run AI models locally without relying on cloud APIs, making NLP tasks faster, more private, and accessible.

At five, **{vercel-ai-sdk}** is a great tool for integrating AI agents into web applications. The SDK provides an abstraction that lets you connect to any LLM. It works seamlessly with Next.js applications, allowing developers to create exceptional user experiences by leveraging features like streaming. While it doesn’t have LangChain’s flexibility in terms of agent orchestration, it’s often considered the best choice for LLM interaction in the TypeScript ecosystem.
