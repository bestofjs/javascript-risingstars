#### Overall winner: shadcn/ui did it again üèÜ

As in 2023, {shadcn-ui} is the hottest project of the year. It found a perfect balance between robust foundations (provided by headless component libraries such as {radix}) and customization possibilities.

The idea of letting developers own the code of their components, instead of providing components you have to `import`, was really a game changer.

A lot of features were added in 2024:

- [Charts](https://ui.shadcn.com/charts) powered by the library [Recharts](http://recharts.org/)
- [Themes](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes) to generate sets of CSS variables you can customize in your codebase
- [Blocks](https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks): a collection of layouts to address the needs of typical web apps
- New components such as a responsive and extensible sidebar

The new CLI is much more powerful and flexible:

- `shadcn add` can now install components, themes, hooks, utils, dependencies, etc.
- It supports multiple frameworks: Next.js, Remix, Vite, Laravel, etc.
- It can update your Tailwind config instead of overriding it
- Support for monorepos

Even more impressive: the `shadcn` CLI can import components from any "registry" (not just shadcn/ui), creating an ecosystem of compatible component libraries, as seen in the following projects included in the _Component Libraries_ rankings:

- {motion-primitives}
- {magic-ui}

Another reason for its success is the tight integration with the service [v0](https://v0.dev) that can generate components built on top of shadcn/ui.

It's also a great learning resource to show how to create composable components that are easy to extend, as components are right in your source folder.

#### Number 2: Excalidraw

{excalidraw} is an open-source online tool designed for creating digital drawings and visualizations with a distinctive hand-drawn style that makes it the perfect tool to brainstorm ideas or explain concepts and workflows.

AI features include: Text to Diagram, {Mermaid} to Excalidraw, and Wireframe to Code.

#### Number 3: AFFiNE

{affine} is an open-source knowledge base and project management tool that combines the capabilities of tools like Notion (with documents made of blocks) and Miro (infinite canvas for drawing).

Being offline-first, it's a great tool to build one's Personal Knowledge Base.
