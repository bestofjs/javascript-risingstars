#### Overall winner: shadcn/ui did it again üèÜ

As in 2023, {shadcn-ui} is the hottest project of the year. It found a perfect balance between robust foundations (provided by headless component libraries such as {radix}) and customization possibilities.

The idea of letting developers own the code of their components, instead of providing components you have to `import`, was really a game changer.

A lot of features were added in 2024: themes, blocks, new components.

The new CLI is much more powerful and flexible:

- `shadcn add` can now install components, themes, hooks, utils, dependencies‚Ä¶
- It supports multiple frameworks: Next.js, Remix, Vite, Laravel...
- It can update your Tailwind config instead of overriding it

#### Number 2: Excalidraw

{excalidraw} is an open-source online tool designed for creating digital drawings and visualizations with a distinctive hand-drawn style that makes it the perfect tool to brainstorm ideas or explain concepts and workflows.

AI features include: Text to Diagram, Mermaid to Excalidraw, and Wireframe to Code.

#### Number 3: Affine

{affine} is an open-source knowledge base and project management tool that combines the capabilities of tools like Notion (with documents made of blocks) and Miro (infinite canvas for drawing).

Being offline-first, it's a great tool to build one's Personal Knowledge Base.
