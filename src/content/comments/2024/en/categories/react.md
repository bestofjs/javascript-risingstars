2024 saw React paradoxically become both more opinionated and less opinionated.

On one hand, React has grown more opinionated with the introduction of Server Components and Server Functions, steering developers toward architectures that operate across the wire. On the other hand, it has become less opinionated as these new primitives are being adopted and abstracted by several frameworks, each taking its own approach.

React is no longer just a library. It is evolving into a specification for frameworks, representing a significant shift in the ecosystem toward a framework-first mindset. However, it still allows developers to opt-out of this mindset and stay closer to the client if they prefer.

During all this transformation, React remains committed to refining its core. The ongoing development of the [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) focuses on improving both performance and the developer experience. With the release of [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19), support for [custom elements](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/) has been introduced, along with new hooks and form actions that redefine how forms are managed in React.

I'm now excited by the possibilities React 19 unlocks. React is becoming a full-stack framework, and it's fascinating to see how this will shape the future of web development with all the players in the React ecosystem.
