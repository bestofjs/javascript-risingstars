This year has been a good one in the Vue ecosystem. Vue itself has seen a much more active release cycle from the core team, with new minors delivering regular performance improvements. For example, the [the reactivity system was reworked](https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/10397) in v3.5, with another change to use the new, lighter, [alien-signals](https://github.com/stackblitz/alien-signals) approach already [landing in the main branch](https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/12349) .

One of the most marked signs of the ecosystem's confidence can be seen in its UI libraries. They are flourishing. Of course, part of what's enabling this is Tailwind CSS. Its convention-based approach to writing CSS and cross-framework capability means that UI libraries like {shadcn-vue} or {Radix-Vue} (soon to be [Reka UI](https://reka-ui.com/) ) could be straightforwardly ported from their React equivalents. Equally, Vue-native libraries like {Element-Plus} and {Naive-UI} continue to thrive, with dedicated user bases and consistent growth.

However, the best result of all UI libraries has come from [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) , which can integrate _with_ Tailwind CSS but doesn't require it. PrimeVue made it into the 2nd place spot with a whopping 5.4k stars. They have seen sustained development this year, and have ambitions in the React and Angular ecosystems as well - good news for the [Primefaces](https://www.primefaces.org/) ecosystem as a whole.

We also see a number of frameworks like Nuxt, Slidev, VitePress and {Vue-Element-Admin} which are doing very well indeed.

{Slidev} offers an incredible, interactive experience for developing slides, with significant improvements rolled out this year including [Twoslash](https://twoslash.netlify.app/) improvements and Magic Move support.

{VitePress} continues to be a case-study in generating static sites built with Vue, and offers rock-solid performance and a great developer experience. It remains the go-to for documentation websites in the Vue ecosystem and beyond, but can be used much more broadly.

{Nuxt} tops the list. As the most used meta-framework in the Vue space, a big part of this year's work has been solidifying the changes made in Nuxt 3, and preparations for a smooth transition to the next Nuxt major in v4. But we've also seen the release of new core modules like [Nuxt Fonts](https://fonts.nuxt.com/) (zero config optimised web fonts) and [Nuxt Scripts](https://scripts.nuxt.com/) (performant third-party script loading), and development on [nuxt-auth-utils](https://github.com/atinux/nuxt-auth-utils), which is being developed into a core Nuxt auth solution.

For all of the libraries we see on the list, developer experience remains a top priority and the next year promises some pretty exciting things for Vue developers, like Vapor mode (at last), stabilised Suspense in Vue 3.6, a next Nuxt major release - and more.
