At number two in 2023, **{htmx}** reached the top of the frontend framework category in 2024.

It can be considered an extension of the HTML language (hence its name) and is often regarded as a library rather than a framework. However, the boundary is blurry. Check out this article explaining [why htmx is another framework](https://htmx.org/essays/is-htmx-another-javascript-framework/).

It’s a great choice if you need to enhance a static site with interactivity or if your application’s state is "server-driven." By using only a combination of HTML `hx-*` attributes, you can implement features like data fetching without writing a single line of JavaScript.

Want to see it in action? This "Rising Stars" site is built with Astro, and htmx powers features such as the lazy loading of extra categories when you scroll down.

At **{2}**, React keeps reinventing itself, which is part of its success. It took more than three years to release version 19, but it finally launched [in December](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19) after back-and-forth changes related to the Suspense API. Check out the [React 19 cheatsheet](https://www.epicreact.dev/react-19-cheatsheet) for more details.

At **{3}**, **{svelte}** also had a major release with [version 5](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-5-is-alive). The standout change is the introduction of "runes," an explicit mechanism for declaring reactive state.
