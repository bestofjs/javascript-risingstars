Many people were worried, thinking it could be a good reason to ditch React in a company (especially in a big company!).\n\n这让一些开发者开始了对React生态圈强烈抵制。许多人也为此担心，这会成为公司丢弃React的一个好借口（尤其在大公司）。\n\nFirst Facebook reacted by explaining on their [official blog](https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/) how the "BSD + Parents" helps them contribute to open source.\n\n首先Facebook在[官方博客](https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/)上解释了"BSD + Parents"协议是如何帮助他们为开源事业做贡献的。\n\nLast September, the concerns were so loud that Facebook addressed the problem and changed several licenses to MIT.\n\n接着在去年9月份，迫于强大的压力Facebook最终把协议变成了MIT来彻底解决这个问题。\n\nFirst by [Relicensing React, Jest, Flow, and Immutable.js](https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246).\n\n先是[Relicensing React, Jest, Flow, and Immutable.js](https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246)修改了协议。\n\nLater it was [GraphQL specification turn](https://medium.com/@leeb/relicensing-the-graphql-specification-e7d07a52301b).\n\n接下来是 [GraphQL specification turn](https://medium.com/@leeb/relicensing-the-graphql-specification-e7d07a52301b)也该了协议。\n\n\nThis story story denotes how much Facebook became one of the main actors of the JavaScript scene over the last years.\n\n从这件事中也可以看出Facebook近些年已在JavaScript领域中占据了举足轻重的地位。\n\nWe already mentioned {react}, {react-native}, {flow} and {jest} projects, all from Facebook.\n\n我们已说过{react}, {react-native}, {flow} 和 {jest} 项目皆来自Facebook。\n\nWe could also mention {reason}, a new object-functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript, as explained in the [What is ReasonML?](http://2ality.com/2017/11/about-reasonml.html) article from Dr. Axel Rauschmayer.\n\n我们也可以关注{reason}, 这是一门编译到JavaScript的对象-函数式编程语言(object-functional programming language), 详情可以阅读Dr. Axel Rauschmayer的文章[什么是ReasonML?](http://2ality.com/2017/11/about-reasonml.html) \n\n\n### Web Assembly: the next revolution?\n### Web Assembly: 接下来的革命？\n\nOver the years, the web browser became an ubiquitous tool with a lot of capabilities: it can play audio or video, performs heavy calculations in the background using Service Workers.\n\n经过多年的发展，网络浏览器己在不少领域成为通用工具：它能播放音频或视频，在后台服务器端进行密集计算的工作。\n\nBut one of the oldest and hardest obstacles to progress is the performance of the JavaScript programming language itself.\n\n但JavaScript本身有一个历史已久的难点：性能。\n\nWeb Assembly is a new web standard that optimizes things so that code can be read and executed faster.\n\nWeb Assembly是一个新的网络标准，它能优化代码的读取和执行速度。\n\n\nAs Lin Clark explains in this [Cartoon Introduction](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/abridged-cartoon-introduction-webassembly/), WebAssembly is a way of taking code written in programming languages other than JavaScript and running that code in the browser.\n\n正如Lin Clark在[Cartoon Introduction](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/abridged-cartoon-introduction-webassembly/)的解释, WebAssembly是能在浏览器里不写JavaScript，而能使用其它编程语言的一种方法。\n\nTo add Web Assembly to your web page, you need to compile it into a `.wasm` file.\nAnd then you will have to load this `.wasm` in the browser and it will run super-fast!\n\n想要在网页中使用Web Assembly，你需要编译成一个`.wasm`文件。\n然后在浏览器中加载这个`.wasm`，你便会发现它能运行得飞快！\n\n\nIn August, Sean Lark announced that {webpack} project was [awarded $125,000 By Mozilla](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-awarded-125-000-from-moss-program-f63eeaaf4e15) implement first-class support for WebAssembly.\n\n在八月份, Sean Lark宣布{webpack}项目得到了Mozilla项目125，000美元[awarded $125,000 By Mozilla](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-awarded-125-000-from-moss-program-f63eeaaf4e15)的赞助来实现对WebAssembly头等支持。\n\nMozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge all provide support for WebAssembly in their most recent versions.\n\nMozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, 和Microsoft Edge都表示会在最近的版本中对WebAssembly支持。\n\n[High-Performance Applications in Your Browser](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/webassembly-will-finally-let-you-run-highperformance-applications-in-your-browser) is really promising, will it be the next revolution?\n\n[在你的浏览器中运行高性能的应用](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/webassembly-will-finally-let-you-run-highperformance-applications-in-your-browser)，看了后期待满满，它真的会是下一个革命？\n\n## Node.js growing up\n## 仍在快速成长的Node.js\n\n{nodejs} keeps evolving at a fast pace. The biggest change is the adoption, since the release 7.6 of the [`async await` pattern](https://hackernoon.com/6-reasons-why-javascripts-async-await-blows-promises-away-tutorial-c7ec10518dd9).\nThis pattern makes asynchronous code easier to read and to write: no more callback, no more promise chain.\n\n{nodejs}继续保持了快速前进的步伐。最大的变化是易用性上，7.6版本加入了[`async await` 模式](https://hackernoon.com/6-reasons-why-javascripts-async-await-blows-promises-away-tutorial-c7ec10518dd9)。\n这个模式可以让异步的代码容易阅读和书写：不再需要回调，不再需要promise链。\n\n\nIt can make easier the onboarding of backend developers coming from other backgrounds.\n\n这让那些后台开发转过来的开发者能更容易上手。\n\nIt\'s good to know that, under the hood, this pattern uses the `Promise` specification.\n\n值得注意的是，从底层原理上来讲，这个模式其实是使用了`Promise` 规范。\n\nThe `async await` pattern comes from the ECMAScript 2017 specification. Node.js made a lot of progress to include natively a lot of these modern features, a compiler like {babel} is no more needed to write modern JavaScript backend code。\n\n`async await` 模式来自ECMAScript 2017规范。Node.js做了非常大的努力来导入这些新特性，所以在写后端代码时，像{babel}这样的编译器已经不再是必要的了。\n\nThe next step coming soon is the adoption of [ES6 modules](http://2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html).\n\n下一步将是[ES6 modules]模块的采用。\n\n\nThe point number 2 showing Node.js maturity is {npm}, the Node.js Package Manager\n\n第二点变化是Node.js的包管理{npm}也更加成熟了。\n\nIn 2016, {yarn} emerged as one of the _Rising Stars_ of 2016 (the project number 3 overall). It was an attempt from Facebook to fix some of the npm flaws by:\n\n在2016年，{yarn}一鸣惊人地出现在了2016年_明星项目_榜单中(排名第3)。Facebook做了如下工作去试图填补npm的缺陷：\n\n* Improving install performance\n* 改进安装时的性能\n* Making install results more predictable, using a file that locks the exact version of all installed packages.\n* 通过锁住己安装包的版本号来让结果更加可以预测。\n\n{yarn} is so popular that a lot of project documentation pages explain that you can start the installation process using either `npm install` or `yarn add` command.\n\n广受欢迎的{yarn}甚至让许多项目在自己的文档中提到你可以同时使用 `npm install` 或 `yarn add` 命令来进行安装.\n\nBut {npm} made a lot of progresses since the release of the version 5, addressing the two issues mentioned above and making {yarn} less relevant than before.\n\n不过{npm}在第5个版本中进行了大量的改进，解决了上面提到的两个问题，使得{yarn}不再具有这方面的优势。\n\nAmong other improvements, we could also mention `npx` a tool that lets developers run locally installed packages easily, as explained here: [Introducing npx: an npm package runner](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b).\n\n在其中诸多改进中, 我们也要提及`npx`这个工具， 它可以让开发者更容易地在本地运行已经安装的包, 这里有注解:

more than what any other framework got, including React and Angular.\n\nThe [version 2](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-0-is-here-ef1f26acf4b8#.lekly4sa8), that takes advantage of the Virtual DOM for performance, was released in October.\n\n{vuejs} is used in production by big companies (including Alibaba, the biggest e-commerce company in China), so you can consider it as a safe choice.\n\nThere is already a quite mature eco-system around it, including a router ({vue-router}) and a state management library ({vuex}).\n\nIt seems that {vuejs} took the best of {react} (the component approach) and {angular-1} (templates are html code enhanced by the framework

A lot of developers feel like they need types in their code, especially in big code base, to make it more robust and easier to read/understand.\n\nJavaScript本身带有基本的动态类型，但缺乏静态类型。不过很多开发者喜欢在代码中使用类型，尤其在大型项目中，这样可以让代码变得更为健壮（robust）且易于阅读和理解。\n\nAnd then, if you think you need types, the 2 main contenders are: {typescript}, provided by MicroSoft and {flow}, provided by Facebook (and used on their main projects: {react}, {react-native}, {jest}...)\n\n如果你需要类型，有两个主流可选项：微软的{typescript}和Facebook的{flow}（Facebook在它们的主要项目{react}, {react-native}, {jest}...中有使用)\n\nRead this article from [James Kyle](https://github.com/thejameskyle) to understand the difference: [A Comparison Between Adopting Flow or TypeScript](https://medium.com/the-thinkmill/adopting-flow-typescript-3549a3a36d51)\n\n你可以从[James Kyle](https://github.com/thejameskyle)的文章来感受两者的区别: [A Comparison Between Adopting Flow or TypeScript](https://medium.com/the-thinkmill/adopting-flow-typescript-3549a3a36d51)\n',year:"2017"}}},{node:{relativePath:"2017/categories/css-in-js/en.md",size:"1710",base:"en.md",ext:".md",internal:{contentDigest:"dabe0a0727c54041395a5d847fe1f329"},fields:{key:"categories.css-in-js",language:"en",markdown:'There is still no consensus about the best way to style React components.\n\nYou can use a ready-made component toolkit like {material-ui} or {ant-design} if your needs are pretty "standard" and you don\'t need too much customization.\n\nOr, if you need more flexibility, you can do it the "old way", using global CSS styles from a popular CSS toolkit like {bootstrap} or {bulma}, and assigning appropriate `className`s to your components.
