{vuejs} and {react} keep fighting hard at the top of the _Front-end Frameworks_ category.

Behind them, {angular} regains the third position, switching its 2019 position with {svelte}.

The new face in the TOP 5 is {alpinejs}, a minimalist reactive framework for the browser, from the creator of [Laravel LiveWire](https://laravel-livewire.com/).

It borrows ideas from both Vue.js and Angular: custom HTML directives, two-way binding...

It's very easy to check it using with a good old `<script>` tag added to an HTML page, no building process is needed, everything can be done right from the HTML mark-up so it may be the perfect solution to enhance quickly an existing web page without having to include a full-blown framework.

Being a very lightweight solution to bring interactivity to a web page, it plays well with modern frameworks like [Elixir Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). There is even a stack called [PETAL](https://thinkingelixir.com/petal-stack-in-elixir/) that includes both {alpinejs} and {tailwind-css}, more on that later...
