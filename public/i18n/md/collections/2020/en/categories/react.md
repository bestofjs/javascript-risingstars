The theme of the React ecosystem in 2020 was stability. While React 17 introduced no breaking changes, it laid the groundwork for the future: [React Server Components](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html).

React Server Components will change how we build React applications by reducing client bundle sizes and improving boot time. Further, they will simplify data fetching and access to data sources like databases and file systems.

{nextjs} has grown into the most popular solution for building React applications. Its hybrid approach will be the first application of React Server Components.

Supporting libraries like {react-query}, {recoil}, and {react-hook-form} have matured and evolved around hooks. Each simplifies a piece of React development. When combined with polished component libraries, React developers have more tools than ever.
