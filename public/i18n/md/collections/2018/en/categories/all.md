These are the hottest projects of the year, all categories included.

For the third time in a row, {vuejs} is the trendiest project of the year.

It got 45k stars overs the last 12 months, it's 5,000 more stars than in 2017... the momentum is still there!

At position number 4, {deno} is the only new project among the TOP 10.

Deno is "a program for executing JavaScript and TypeScript outside of the web browser."

According to its creator Ryan Dahl (the father of Node.js), this secure TypeScript runtime is an attempt of addressing several issues about Node.js. Watch [his video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA).
