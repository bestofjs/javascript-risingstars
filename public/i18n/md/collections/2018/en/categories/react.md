No surprise in the React eco-system category, the project number one in 2018 is {create-react-app}, the de-facto tool to start a new React application.

The version 2 was released in 2018, it was a major upgrade that includes the version 4 of {webpack} and the possibility to use {typescript}.

About the React library itself, the introduction of [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) is a major addition, that may change a lot of things about the way we deal with state management and side effects with React.
