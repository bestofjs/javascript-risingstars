The 2 leading Node.js frameworks in 2018 are "full-stack frameworks" related to a specific front-end framework:

* {nextjs}, the new champion of the category, uses {react} 
* {nuxt} uses {vuejs}.

They both provide a great developer experience to set up Single-Page Applications, while providing Server-Side Rendering features.

At position number 4 {express}, the number one in 2017, stays very popular, despite its age.
