{ngx-admin}, the most popular Angular project, provides templates to create admin dashboards.

At number 2 is {material-design-for-angular} which includes Material Design components as well as the Angular CDK.

Similarly to React and Vue, the Ant Design component library {ng-zorro} is at number 4.

Angular had one major release in 2019. [Version 8](https://blog.angular.io/version-8-of-angular-smaller-bundles-cli-apis-and-alignment-with-the-ecosystem-af0261112a27) was released in May. As part of that release, {angular-cli} now creates two seperate bundles (modern and legacy) shrinking bundle sizes up to 20%. There is also a new Builders API which allows you to modify existing CLI commands or add new commands.

Version 9 is currently in release candidate and is expected to come out early 2020. A major change for version 9 will be a new compiler called Ivy which is expected to have faster re-build time and smaller bundle sizes, among other improvements.
