In the Node.js framework category, we have a new champion: {nest}!

Nest is a full-featured web framework that borrows a lot of concepts from {angular}.

{nextjs}, the champion of 2018, is number 2 this year. It's one of the best solutions to build a full-stack web application with React on the front-end and Node.js in the back-end.

At position number 3, {strapi} is a completely open source headless CMS that allows you to quickly generate and manage API endpoints.
“Get started in just four commands”.
API Endpoints can be consumed using REST or GraphQL!

Following is {nuxt}, a full-stack framework to build web applications with Vue.js, supporting differents strategies, server-side rendering, client-side only or static generated.

{express} is almost as old as Node.js but it's still in the top 5. Of course it has a huge eco-system and it's familiar to a lot of Node.js developers but it's worth mentioning that the last commit was made 7 months ago. Times are changing?
