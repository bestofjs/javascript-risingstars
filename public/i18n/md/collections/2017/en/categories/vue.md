With the rising popularity of Vue itself, many Vue ecosystem projects also enjoyed rapid growth in 2017.

{element} and {iview} are the two most popular UI component kits, both focused on rapid desktop UI development. {mint-ui} and {vux}, on the other hand, are the two most popular mobile-focused UI kits.

{vuetify} is a Material Design component framework that can be used for both mobile and desktop web apps, and is probably the most feature rich with server-side rendering, PWA and CLI template support. There's also {vue-material} which focuses more on providing a set components that strictly adhere to the Material Design spec.

{nuxt} is a higher-level framework built on top of Vue that provides a very smooth development experience for building universal, server-rendering Vue applications. It is also very versatile - you can use the same codebase to ship a normal SPA, or even generate a static site.

{weex} is a framework that allows users to develop native-rendering mobile apps using familiar Vue syntax and API. It is developed by Alibaba and used in production in some of the most heavily used mobile apps in the world, with a strong focus on performance.
