When future historians look back at the history of GraphQL, 2017 might very well be a turning point. 

Major companies such as [the New York Times](https://open.nytimes.com/react-relay-and-graphql-under-the-hood-of-the-times-website-redesign-22fb62ea9764) have started adopting GraphQL, and on the library front both [Relay](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1362748677097871/relay-modern-simpler-faster-more-extensible/) and [Apollo](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/apollo-client-2-0-5c8d0affcec7) (the two main GraphQL client libraries) released major updates this year. 

Beyond these two big players, companies like [Graphcool](http://www.graph.cool/) have also released a plethora of tools and libraries, and GraphQL-powered full-stack frameworks like [Vulcan](http://vulcanjs.org) are also starting to create their own niche. 

It's also worth mentioning that this year's most popular static site generator [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org) also uses GraphQL as part of its data processing chain. 

With so many players venturing out in the GraphQL galaxy, it's only a matter of time before the technology becomes a widespread alternative to REST.
