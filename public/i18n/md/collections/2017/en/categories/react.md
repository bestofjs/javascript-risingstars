The {react} library being only the view layer, it creates space for a whole ecosystem that is moving very fast. In this category, we included projects built on top of {react} and {react-native} libraries.

In 2016 {create-react-app} solved the problem of how to start coding a React application by providing a nice set of presets, very well packaged. Facebook keeps releasing new versions very often and it was by far the most popular project in 2017 among the React ecosystem.

As an example of its success, we could mention [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), an online IDE that lets you run application created from {create-react-app}, right from the browser, in a few seconds.

But even if {create-react-app} is often considered as the default "starter kit" for React, developers may need more opinionated starter kits: {react-boilerplate} was the most popular project in this category, providing a lot of feature like the GraphQL integration.

{ant-design}, {ant-design-pro} and {material-ui} are sets of styled React components to help developers create a web application with React components, without worrying about the styling.

{recompose}'s popularity denotes one of the features seasoned developers love about React: its "functional" approach, everything is just a function and {recompose} provides a full set of helpers to go further in this direction.
