Here we talk about the text editors from the open source world, built with web technologies (sorry for Sublime users!).

In 2016, {vs-code}, backed by Microsoft and {atom}, backed by GitHub were really close at the top of the category.

They also led the way in 2017 but {vs-code} took a big advantage over its rival.

Every month, a new version of {vs-code} is released bringing, more and more helpful features to the IDE, without sacrificing performance too much.
Out of the box, without installing anything, you have a great set of features:

* Git integration
* Autocomplete for a lot of things: JavaScript syntax, local file paths when you `require` or `import` a module, NPM packages names...
* React syntax integration

If you add {prettier} to the mix, asking the editor to automatically format your files every time you save, you have the perfect combo to enjoy code poetry!
