JavaScript is so ubiquitous that you can build native mobile applications using technologies web developers already know (HTML, JavaScript, CSS).

#### {react-native}

With React Native, from the same code base, you can build iOS and Android real **native** mobile applications, using concepts familiar to React developers. To know more about building applications for both iOS and Android, read [this tutorial](http://makeitopen.com/).

Other solutions, based on Cordova, used to rely on Webview to render the screens and were not as efficient as a native solution.
"Write Once Run Everywhere"... This is a developer's dream came true!

#### {ionic}

{ionic} was a pioneer with the concept of "hybrid" applications.
Under the hood, it's based on Cordova to access the mobile device features. It's very mature with a large eco-system.

#### {nativescript}

{nativescript} aims for the same goal as {react-native} (build real mobile applications using web technologies). It comes in 2 flavors, NativeScript Core and NativeScript + Angular 2

#### Looking forward...

A project to follow closely in 2017: [Weex](https://weex-project.io/), *a framework for building Mobile cross-platform UI* built on top of {vuejs}.
