Despite the JavaScript fatigue™ and the dramas (remember the ["leftpad gate"](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/left-pad-indicative-fragile-javascript-ecosystem/)), 2016 was a great year for the community, with the rise of projects like {vuejs} and {react-native}, and new projects like {yarn} or {create-react-app}.

We have been talking about projects that got traction on Github in 2016 but what really matters is developer's satisfaction.
So if you want a more qualitative approach, check the results from Sacha Greif’s [State of JavaScript](http://stateofjs.com/) survey. More than 9,000 responses were collected!

It's time to think about 2017, where are the next rising stars?

Here are my 10 picks of the year, the projects and the ideas I liked in 2016 and that will keep up growing in 2017:

* {vuejs}: the momentum will not stop
* {electron}
* {create-react-app}
* {react-native}
* {gatsby} (used to build this page!)
* {yarn}: a fast, reliable and secure dependency management that can replace npm, you can read about the state of node.js package managers [here](https://blog.risingstack.com/yarn-vs-npm-node-js-package-managers/)
* The concept of "Progressive Web Applications"
* Node.js micro-services made easy to deploy with a hosting solution like [Now](https://zeit.co/now)
* The evolution of {nodejs}: the latest releases support very well the ES6 syntax
* And one more pick would be {graphql}: all my friends told me that something big is coming!
