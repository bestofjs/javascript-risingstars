### And the 2016 winner is... 🏆

{vuejs} project got more than 25,000 stars on Github last year, it means 72 stars per day, it's more than what any other framework got, including React and Angular.

The [version 2](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-0-is-here-ef1f26acf4b8#.lekly4sa8), that takes advantage of the Virtual DOM for performance, was released in October.

{vuejs} is used in production by big companies (including Alibaba, the biggest e-commerce company in China), so you can consider it as a safe choice.

There is already a quite mature eco-system around it, including a router ({vue-router}) and a state management library ({vuex}).

It seems that {vuejs} took the best of {react} (the component approach) and {angular-1} (templates are html code enhanced by the framework features).
