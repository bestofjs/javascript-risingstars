About IDE (*Integrated Development Environment*), it's worth to mention that 2 of the most popular IDEs are open-source projects made with web technologies.

#### {visual-studio-code}

In our results, Microsoft leads the way with {visual-studio-code}.

It provides a nice integration with {typescript} and node.js.
Some developers mention improvement about development speed thanks to the *IntelliSense* feature (a mix of highlighting and autocomplete).

Saying "open source" and "Microsoft" in the same sentence is no more an oxymoron!

#### {atom}

{atom}, pushed by Github and built with {electron} (like several other desktop applications, including the Slack desktop client) is not far behind {visual-studio-code}. An interesting fact about Atom: its main language is CoffeeScript!
