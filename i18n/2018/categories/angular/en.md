Not one but two major upgrades in the Angular ecosystem in 2018! 

[Angular version 6](https://blog.angular.io/version-6-of-angular-now-available-cc56b0efa7a4), introduced in May, provides a lot of features related to the tooling.

As a consequence, the trendiest project of the Angular ecosystem was {angular-cli} the official command line tool used to scaffold new projects and manage existing projects.

Among the new features, the `update` command makes it easy to update an application and its dependencies.
Also, it's possible to customize the underlying {webpack} configuration without "ejecting".

[Angular version 7](https://blog.angular.io/version-7-of-angular-cli-prompts-virtual-scroll-drag-and-drop-and-more-c594e22e7b8c) was announced in October. 

It includes a major upgrade of {material-design-for-angular} and focuses on performance improvements, with a feature called "Virtual Scrolling".

It's worth mentioning that {angular-1} was still trendy in 2018 (project number 15 overall).
