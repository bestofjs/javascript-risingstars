React Native is still the leading solution to create mobile applications using the JavaScript language.

Airbnb recently published [a thorough series of article](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c) explaining why they decided to drop React Native for their next products in favor of Native Apps.

For people who want to use {vuejs} instead of {react}, there are several choices.

The 4 following projects of the category ({weex}, {nativescript}, {quasar} and {ionic}) all support {vuejs} as the view layer to build mobile applications.

It's not a JavaScript project because it uses the Dart language but [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) from Google is a great alternative to build cross-environment mobile applications.
