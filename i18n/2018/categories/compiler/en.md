There were discussions in the past about the best way to introduce static typing to JavaScript.

In 2018, it seems that {typescript}, from Microsoft took a big advantage over its archival {flow}, from Facebook.

The fact that the latest version of {babel} supports TypeScript was a game changer.

TypeScript is almost a standard for development: whether it's back-end or front-end development, we see more and more libraries that include TypeScript definitions. And if types are not provided by the library itself, the project {definitelytyped} provides types for thousands of JavaScript projects.
