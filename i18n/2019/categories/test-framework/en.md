This year, instead of limiting the category to the frameworks used to write test suites, we have also included tools related to End-to-End (E2E) testing and browser automation.

{puppeteer} is a very popular tool to control a headless Chrome browser. It has a lot a use cases (scrapping the web, taking snapshots of web pages...) and it's used by the Chrome extension {puppeteer-recorder}, at position number 6.

{storybook} is a UI component workshop that provides development, testing, documentation, and a rich addon ecosystem. In 2019 it upgraded to an example format that can be directly imported in {jest} and other testing tools.

{cypress} is a solution to do end-to-end testing, it provides a very nice UI to describe interactions between a user and web page.

At position number 4, {jest} is the most popular testing framework, used in both front-end and back-end projects.

At position 5 {react-testing-library} is a solution to test React applications built on top of the [DOM Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library) by Kent C. Dodds. It provides nice patterns and abstractions to help test how an application should behave, instead of testing implementation details.
