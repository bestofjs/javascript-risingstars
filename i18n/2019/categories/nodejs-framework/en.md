In the Node.js framework category, we have a new champion: {nest}!

Nest is a full-featured web framework that borrows a lot of concepts from {angular}.

{nextjs}, the champion of 2018, is number 2 this year. It's one of the best solutions to build a full-stack web application with React on the front-end and Node.js in the back-end.

At position number 3, {strapi} is a completely open source headless CMS that allows you to quickly generate and manage API endpoints.
“Get started in just four commands”.
API Endpoints can be consumed using REST or GraphQL!

{express} is almost as old as Node.js but it's still in the top 5. Of course it has a huge eco-system and it's familiar to a lot of Node.js developers but it's worth mentioning that the last commit was made 7 months ago. Times are changing?
