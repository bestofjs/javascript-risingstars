Of course JavaScript is no more limited to the front-end side of web applications, it's more and more used to create the back-end too, and [Mikeal Rogers](https://github.com/mikeal), an influent member of the node.js community, predicts that [Node.js Will Overtake Java Within a Year](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-profile-mikeal-rogers-node-js/).

But unlike other languages where de-facto standards have emerged over the years (think about Ruby on Rails for Ruby, Django for Python or Laravel for PHP), there is no golden standard or recommended architecture when you want to create a new node.js server.

Despite its age, {express} was not only the trendiest node.js framework in 2017 but it's also used as the backbone of many other frameworks or CMS, including {feathers}, {keystone} or {nest}.

It seems that Express minimalist approach perfectly matches the micro-services trend that promotes the creation of several decoupled smaller applications over the development of a single "monolith" application.

Compared to last year, 3 newcomers joined the TOP 10 node.js frameworks:

* {fastify} is built as a general-purpose web framework, inspired by {hapi}, but is well suited to building fast JSON-based HTTP APIs.
* {serverjs} aims to be a ‘everything works out of the box’ experience.
* {nest} features an architecture familiar to Angular developers, made of modules and controller, written in TypeScript.
