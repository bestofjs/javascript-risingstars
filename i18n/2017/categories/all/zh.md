在这里我们列出了今年最火的项目, 包括所有类别。

### Vue.js strikes again
### Vue.js蝉联冠军

Once again, {vuejs} is the trendiest project of the year, with more than 40,000 stars added on GitHub during the year.
再次，{vuejs}成为了年度排行榜的冠军，今年在GitHub上新增了超过40,000的star。

It's far more than in 2016 (26,000 stars), and the gap with the next contender ({react}) is even bigger.
相比于2016年(26,000Star)，今年Vue.js相比排行榜第2 ({react})，优势更大了。

So what makes Vue.js special?
那么,是什么令Vue.js如此特别？


* First, it has a small learning curve, with a component approach similar to {react} but with a more familiar syntax.
* The ecosystem is well defined, including a set of de-facto standards:
  * Router: {vue-router}
  * State management library: {vuex}
* The concept of single-file component that includes template, logic and styles in a single file `.vue` file is really nice.
* It's used by one of the most popular PHP frameworks, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), as its default view engine.
* It's not backed by a big company of the Internet like Facebook or Google but maintained by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) as an open-source project sponsored through crowd-sourcing.
* 首先，它有平缓的学习曲线，有与{react}相似的组件方案却更令人熟悉的语法。
* 设计优秀(well defined)的生态系统，例如一些既定标准(de-facto standards):
  * 路由: {vue-router}
  * 状态管理库: {vuex}
* 单文件非常棒
* 被最流行的PHP框架之一的[Laravel](https://laravel.com/)选为默认的视图引擎(View engine)
* 并非Facebook或Googld这样的互联网巨头来支持，而是由[Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803)个人维护，以众筹方式来支持的开源项目 It's not backed by a big company of the Internet like Facebook or Google but maintained by [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) as an open-source project sponsored through crowd-sourcing.

And this may be related with the last point, but Vue.js is very popular among developers from China. It's used by the biggest e-commerce platform of China (Alibaba), but also by companies like GitLab or Adobe.
也许正是上述最后一点的原因，Vue.js在中国拥有大量的拥趸。不仅被中国最大的电商平台阿里巴巴使用，也有Gitlab与Adobe这样的公司青睐。

### React, No.2, 再一次！
### React, number 2, again!

Like in 2016, {react} is number 2, with more than 27,000 stars added on GitHub (note that we're specifically talking about stars *added* over the year, not the *total* number of stars).
与2016一样, {react}夺得第二名, 今年它在GitHub上获得了超过27,000star数量 (再次明确此处我们讨论的是整个年度*新增*的Stars数量而非*所有*的Star数量)。

{create-react-app}, the third project, is the recommended way to start a new project with React, and its success made a lot of React boilerplates less relevant than before.
{create-react-app}, 作为为了一个第三方的项目，却成为了新建React项目的推荐方法，它的成功让不少React样板(React boilerplates)与之前的相比完全不再相关。

[Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) (the creator of {redux}, now working for Facebook) did a great job, finding the right balance between simplicity and features. For example there is no fancy styling solution (just plain CSS), no server-side rendering, but everything is well packaged and the developer experience is really good.
[Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) ({redux}作者, 现在Facebook工作) did a great job, 他在简洁与功能间找到了正确平衡(right balance)。 例如它没有花哨的样式解决方案(styling solution)(只有纯CSS)与无服务器端渲染, 但是一切又很好的封装了，同时开发者体验也很不错。

### Axios

The {axios} library is the most used HTTP client.
{axios} 库是最广泛使用的HTTP客户端。


It can work on both the client side (AJAX requests from the client) or on the server-side (HTTP requests in a Node.js environment)
它能同时在用户端(在用户端发起AJAX请求)与服务器端(在Node.js环境中)使用。

Its success may be related to Vue.js too, because a lot of Vue.js tutorials use it to query a distant API through HTTP.
Axios的成功或许也与Vue.js有些关系，因为诸多Vue.js教程中用到了它来发起远程API的HTTP请求。

### Puppeteer

{puppeteer} is one of the great stories of the year.
{puppeteer}是今年的大事件之一。

Made by the Google Chrome team, it's a headless Chrome browser, that is to say a browser that runs in the background and that can be by piloted by code.

It can be used to do things like:
它可作如下用途:

* Automatically testing web application UIs in real browsers.
* 在真正的浏览器(real browsers)中进行自动化界面测试(UI测试)。

* Taking snapshots of web pages to do server-side rendering.
* 对服务器端渲染的页面进行截图。
