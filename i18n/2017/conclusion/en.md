We hope this round-up of the JavScript universe in 2017 was not too long.

We have seen by the numbers that {vuejs} is once again the winner of this year and its success is not slowing down.

The {react} eco-system keeps growing up, despite an issue related to the license used by Facebook for its open source projects.

If we had to pick one project among the _2017 Rising Stars_ it would be {prettier}, it's so nice to be able to write code without worriyng about formatting.

For an other point view over the trends, check the [State of JavaScript 2017 survey](https://stateofjs.com/), we collected and analyzed responses from more than 23,000 developers.

Going forward, which project will be the next JavaScript Rising Stars in 2018?

* a new framework based on {graphql}?
* a library that takes advantage of the new WebAssembly standard to create a unique experience in the browser?
