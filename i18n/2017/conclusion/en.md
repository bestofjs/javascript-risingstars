We hope you enjoyed this round-up of the JavaScript universe in 2017.

We have seen by the numbers that {vuejs} is once again the winner of this year, and its success is not slowing down.

The {react} eco-system keeps growing up, after finally putting its license-related issues behind it.

But if we had to pick one project among the _2017 Rising Stars_ it would be {prettier}. It's so nice to be able to write code without worrying about formatting!

And for another point view on the latest trends, be sure to also check out the [State of JavaScript 2017 survey](https://stateofjs.com/), where we collected and analyzed responses from more than 23,000 developers.

So going forward, which projects do you think will be the next _JavaScript Rising Stars_ in 2018?

* A new framework based on {graphql}?
* A library that takes advantage of the new WebAssembly standard to create a unique experience in the browser?

Let us know what you think! In the meantime, thank you for your attention, and feel free to share this article or reach us on [Github](https://github.com/bestofjs/javascript-risingstars) if you have any feedback… and see you next year!
