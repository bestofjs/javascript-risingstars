Looking back at 2018, the biggest story in the JavaScript community may be the [Event-stream drama](https://schneid.io/blog/event-stream-vulnerability-explained/), revealed in November.

There were a lot of talks around this drama, about security concerns and the burden of maintaining open-source projects.

Talking about open source, [the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft](https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/) in June was a breaking news.

Over the last months, Microsoft did a lot of moves to become one of the major actors in the JavaScript world, as shown by the success of {typescript} language and {vs-code} editor.

So it may not be so surprising to see a giant like Microsoft taking control of our beloved GitHub… but what a turnaround in the history of Open Source!
