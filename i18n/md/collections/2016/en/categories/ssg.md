Static site generators (or "SSG") are tools that generate a bunch of .html, .css and JavaScript files that you can deploy on any simple web server (Apache or NGNX) without the fuss of setting up a database.
As {gatsby} web site says:

> Build sites like it's 1995

Static web sites are fast, robust and easy to maintain.

SSG are very popular because there are a lot of very good solutions to host static web site for free:

The newcomer {gatsby} is a very interesting solution, it stands out from its contenders because it uses React ecosystem to generate static html files. The fact that you can combine React components, Markdown files and server-side rendering makes it very powerful.
