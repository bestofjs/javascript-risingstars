This _Front-end Frameworks_ category is maybe the one that is responsible for what was called [the JavaScript fatigue](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/javascript-fatigue-fatigue-66ffb619f6ce#.soeh5g56p) in 2016.
It seemed that every month a new contender made the buzz, pushing the pace of innovation!

To be exact, 2 kinds of projects are mixed in the category:

* Full frameworks that include all features to create a modern web application (routing, data fetching, state management). {angular-1}, {angular}, {ember} or {aurelia} fall in this category.
* Lighter solutions that focus on the UI layer, like {react}, {vuejs}, {inferno}...

We have already mentioned {vuejs} (number 1 overall), let's see the other contenders.

#### React and its contenders

{react} is number 2, no front-end developer can ignore React and its rich eco-system.

{react} is so popular that it inspired a lot of other libraries that aim to take the best of React, without the fat, in order to improve both performance in the browser and building time.

{inferno} was the most popular project in this category, it claims to be the fastest alternative to React.

Following closely Inferno in our rankings, {preact} is a nice alternative to React too.
Its eco-system is quite mature, for example there is a boilerplate with offline capabilities, a router, a _compat_ module so that you can use any existing React library inside your Preact project.

#### Angular 1 and 2

Angular project has been split into 2 repositories because Angular 2 is a full rewrite of Angular 1, even if some concepts remain the same.

{angular} is written in TypeScript and takes advantage of ES6 to deliver a modern and thorough framework.

{angular-1} (called "AngularJS" on GitHub) is still used in many projects and will remain popular for a while.

It's worth to mention that {ember}, despite its large eco-system and its community is not in the top 10.

So it seems that, rather than opting for full frameworks with all features "out of the box", developers in 2016 flavored lighter approaches and prefer to compose their own solution "Ã  la carte".
