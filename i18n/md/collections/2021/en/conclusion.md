Let's finish this round-up of the year with some stories.

To build modern sites and applications, it seems we have entered the era of the meta frameworks: Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit... and the new comer Remix.

Popular members of the JavaScript community joined tech companies to work on these solutions:

- Kent C. Dodds joined the Remix team
- Vercel hired everyone else: Rich Harris, the creator of Svelte, Sebastian Markb√•ge from the React core team, Jared Palmer and its now open source Turborepo solution... it looks like a Dream Team!

About the tooling, the need for speed led to a shift a towards languages like Rust and Go instead of JavaScript.

Deno, the winner in 2020 is still a thing! [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy/docs) is a solution to build and deploy serverless functions that run at the edge, close to the users.

Thank you, see you next year!
