Let's finish this round-up of the year with some stories.

To build modern sites and applications, it seems we have entered the era of the meta frameworks: Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit... and the new comer Remix.

Popular members of the JavaScript community joined tech companies to work on these solutions:

- Kent C. Dodds joined the {remix} team
- Vercel hired everyone else: Rich Harris, the creator of {svelte}, Sebastian Markb√•ge from the React core team, Jared Palmer and its now open source {turborepo} solution... it looks like a Dream Team!

About the tooling, the need for speed led to a shift a towards languages like Rust and Go instead of JavaScript.

Lee Robinson made a strong statement: [Rust Is The Future of JavaScript Infrastructure](https://leerob.io/blog/rust) and we mentioned the rise of Rust language several times:

- {tauri} is built in Rust
- The project {rome} made a strong move [from JavaScript to Rust](https://rome.tools/blog/2021/09/21/rome-will-be-rewritten-in-rust)
- Next.js latest version (12) includes {swc} compiler, written in Rust

{deno}, the server-side runtime that was winner in 2020 is still a thing! It keeps receiving enhancements and [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy/docs) was made public: it's a solution to build and deploy serverless functions that run at the "edge", close to the users.

Thank you, see you next year!
