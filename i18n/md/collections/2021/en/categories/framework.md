For the first time since we've ran _JavaScript Rising Stars_, {react} is the number one UI framework, but if we take into account the fact that Vue.js is split into two repositories (for the versions 2 and 3), Vue.js is effectively the leader.

The big change is the rise of {svelte} that takes third, before {angular}.

More and more tools or components include Svelte among the target frameworks (we mentioned {vite} for example).

One of the major headlines of the year is that Rich Harris, the creator of Svelte is joining Vercel the team behind {nextjs}.

Like Next.js, Svelte has its own meta framework to build performant applications: {sveltekit}.

In fifth, {solid} is an interesting alternative to React. Components are written using JSX but it does not rely on the Virtual DOM like React does.

It has inspired {mitosis}, a tool to write and compile components targeting any framework: React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte...
