For the fist time since we run the _JavaScript Rising Stars_, {react} is the UI framework number 1 but if take into account the fact that Vue.js is split into 2 repositories (for Vue.js 2 and 3), Vue.js is still the virtual leader.

The big change is that {Svelte} frameworks keeps rising and takes the spot number 3, before {angularjs}.

More and more tools or components include Svelte among the target frameworks (we mentioned {vite} for example).

One of the big news of the year is that Rich Harris, the creator of Svelte is joining the tech company Vercel whose most successful project is {next}.

Like Next.js, Svelte has its own meta framework to build performant applications: {sveltekit}.
