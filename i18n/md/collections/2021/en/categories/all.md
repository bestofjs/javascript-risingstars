The trendiest project of the year is {zx} a brand new tool by Google to write Command Line scripts in JavaScript or TypeScript.

There are a lot of tools in help with CLI in the Node.js community (see the [CLI tag in Best of JS](https://bestofjs.org/tags/cli)) but zx has a unique combination of simplicity and power that makes scripting easy and fun.

At position number 2, {vite} is a building tool that uses {esbuild} compiler to provides great performance. At the beginning it was linked to the Vue.js community but it has also starter kits for other major frameworks: React, {svelte}, {lit}.

At position number 3, {nextjs} keeps its position of leading "meta framework" for the React world.
