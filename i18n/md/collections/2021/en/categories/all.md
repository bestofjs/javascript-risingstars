The trendiest project of the year is {zx} a brand new tool by Google to write Command Line scripts in JavaScript or TypeScript.

There are lots of tools to help with CLI in the Node.js ecosystem (see the [CLI tag in Best of JS](https://bestofjs.org/tags/cli)) but `zx` has a unique combination of simplicity and power that makes scripting easy and fun.

Basically it lets you embed any bash expression (`ls`, `cat`, `git`... anything!) in your code using [JavaScript template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

It includes utilities provided by several popular packages:

- [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch) to make HTTP requests using the same API as `fetch` in the browser
- [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra) to handle file system operations
- [globby](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby) to match file names given user-friendly patterns

At position number 2, {vite} is a building tool that uses {esbuild} compiler to provide great performance. At the beginning it was linked to the Vue.js community but now it has setups for the main UI frameworks: {react}, {svelte}, {lit}.

At position number 3, {nextjs} keeps its position of leading "meta framework" for the React world.
