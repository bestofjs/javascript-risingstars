One year of Vue 3's official release, we see the ecosystem is growing rapidly with a lot of great innovations.

New syntaxes like `<script setup>` in Vue 3 core takes the component authoring experience into a new level. The new VS Code extension [Volar](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar) brings the first-class TypeScript support to Vue; a new state manager [Pinia](https://github.com/vuejs/pinia), which is built ground up with the new Composition API, becoming the successors of Vuex.

With [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) becoming the new default tooling of Vue, meta-frameworks like [Nuxt 3](https://github.com/nuxt/framework), [Quasar](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar) and [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) are now using Vite as their default engine. Providing tremendous developer experience improvements and opening up many new gates for innovations.

The community also put many efforts on aligning Vue 2's DX to Vue 3 and making the migration process smoother. It was a great year for Vue devs to get huge improvements for both DX and performance of their apps. Excited to see what is upcoming in 2022!
