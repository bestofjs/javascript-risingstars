To build resilient and performant applications, the main UI frameworks have their own "meta framework" that provide a unified solution to build a modern web application, providing features like routing, server-side rendering, static generation of pages ahead of time...

- React has {nextjs}, number 1 of the category, that can be considered as a pioneer in this space
- Vue.js has {nuxt}, split between Vue.js v2 and Vue.js v2 projectss
- Svelte has {sveltekit}

Besides these meta frameworks, at the position number 2, {nest} is the leader of the more conventional Node.js frameworks, not tight to any UI library.

At the position number 3, {strapi} is the leader of the headless CMS, those applications that provide a rich dashboard to let users manage data and a modern API to let developers build anything from data.
