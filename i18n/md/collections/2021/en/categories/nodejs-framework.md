To build resilient and performant applications, the main UI frameworks have their own "meta framework" to build modern web applications, providing features like routing, server-side rendering, static generation of pages ahead of time, optimized builds for production...

- React has {nextjs}, number 1 of the category, that can be considered as a pioneer in this space
- Vue.js has {nuxt}, split between versions for Vue.js v2 and v3
- Svelte has {sveltekit}

{remix} is the newcomer of the category, it's one of the biggest stories of the year. It was created by the authors of [React-router](https://reactrouter.com/).
The repository has been made public in september. It got a lot of traction (and funding too!). Its motto is clear: "Web Fundamentals, Modern UX" as its APIs follow as much as possible the web standards (HTTP responses, form submissions...).

Besides these meta frameworks, at the position number 2, {nest} is the leader of the more conventional server-side Node.js frameworks, not tight to any UI library.

At the position number 3, {strapi} is the leader of the "headless CMS", those applications that provide a rich dashboard to let users manage data and a modern API to let developers build anything from data.
