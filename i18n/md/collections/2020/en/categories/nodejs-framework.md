We have 2 types of projects that dominate the _Node.js Frameworks_ category.

One one hand we have full-stack frameworks like {nextjs} and {nuxt} that bring React and Vue.js to the server-side.

On the other hand we have also more classic options that run only in the server like {nest} (the leader last year) or {fastify}.

Like in 2018, the category is led by {nextjs}. In the beginning it was made famous as a solution to render on the server React applications.

Now it's the leading solution to build full-stack web applications with React.

The latest version provides features such as incremental static rebuild that brings the best of a dynamic and static worlds, making it a great fit for a lot of use cases.

About the full-stack frameworks, {blitz} and {redwood} are the 2 new contenders that aim to provide the best developer experience to build complete web applications.
