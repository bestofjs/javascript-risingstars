The biggest news in the Vue.js community is the release of the version 3.

It comes with the new [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/composition-api.html) that addresses several limitations of Vue.js 2:

- it was hard to organize code by logical concern inside components
- it makes make easier to reuse code across components (with Vue 2, mixins, mixing factory and scoped slots were not optimal)
- it has a better TypeScript support

Check the [migration guide](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/introduction.html) for more details about the changes introduced by the version 3.

Also a new web building tool {vite} was created in 2020. Powered by ES modules, it's the fastest way to get started with a Vue.js application from the command line.
