{vuejs} and {react} keep fighting hard at the top of the _Front-end Frameworks_ category.

Behind, {angular} regains it the third position, switching its 2019 position with {svelte}.

The new face in the TOP 5 is {alpinejs}, a minimalist reactive framework for the browser.

It borrows ideas from both Vue.js and Angular: custom HTML directives, double-way binding...

It's very easy to check it using with a good old `<script>` tag added to an HTML page, no building process is needed, everything can be done right from the HTMl mark-up so it may be the perfect solution to enhance quickly an existing web page without having to include a full-blown framework.
