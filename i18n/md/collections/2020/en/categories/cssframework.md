Compared to last year, we added this section to put emphasize on the success of {tailwind-css} and its "utility first" approach.

Compared to more traditional CSS frameworks like {bootstrap} or {bulma}, it provides naming conventions to let developers style pages and components by composing class names.

According to the [State of CSS](https://2020.stateofcss.com/en-US/report/) beautiful report, it's the CSS framework that has the highest ratio of satisfaction.

[Version 2](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-v2) was released recently and it brings a lot of new features including the support of the beloved "dark mode".
