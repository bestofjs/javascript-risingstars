The hottest project of the year is shadcn/ui, a collection of UI components written in React, allowing customizable styling through TailwindCSS.

Built on top of Radix, a set of headless components providing primitives for concerns like accessibility and keyboard interactions, shadcn/ui distinguishes itself from other popular libraries (such as MUI, ChakraUI, React Spectrum) by not being a downloadable npm package. Instead, you integrate a specific shadcn/ui component by running a Command Line that installs the underlying dependencies (including Radix and other robust headless solutions) and copies the source code directly into your codebase.

It seems all new shiny React projects have adopted shadcn/ui. It was even chosen by Kent C. Dodds for his cutting-edge [Epic Stack](https://www.epicweb.dev/epic-stack).

The project's success is closely tied to the widespread popularity of TailwindCSS, its compatibility with React Server Components, and the presence of excellent documentation.
