{vite} is still the most popular bundler, powering meta frameworks such as Astro, Nuxt, Remix, SolidStart, SvelteKit...

The [version 5](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite5) released in November, is built on top of {rollup} 4, bringing build performance improvement and deprecating support of CommonJS modules.

At two, the rise of {biome} is one of the stories of the year. It's related to the [fail of Rome](https://bytes.dev/archives/175), an ambitious project that aimed to unify the tooling in JS projects (lint, format, bundle, test...) as it was designed to replace Babel, ESLint, Webpack, Prettier, and Jest. The company behind the project failed and the project was stopped this year.

Fortunately the project was forked and re-born under the name of Biome.

In November, Biome won the [Prettier Challenge](https://biomejs.dev/blog/biome-wins-prettier-challenge/): creating a Rust-powered code formatter that could pass over 95% of Prettierâ€™s tests. So we can expect more adoption of Biome in 2024.

Speaking of Rust, {rspack} is a new player in this space that provides compatibility with Webpack while delivering unmatched performance. For the first time since we run the Rising Stars, it's weird not to see the Webpack in the rankings given the number of projects that use it.
