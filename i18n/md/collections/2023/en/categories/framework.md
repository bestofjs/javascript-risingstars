React stays at the top of the rankings in 2023.

At two HTMX is a library that takes a different approach to provide interactivity to HTML page: rather than writing on several lines of JavaScript code, developers enhance HTML with specific attributes to enable real-time interactivity and dynamic updates.

It was lauded for its small file size and seamless integration with existing server-side frameworks, as it's part of the trend "send HTML over the wire": ask the server send partial blocks of HTML instead of handling JSON in the client.

In the same space of "tagging libraries", {alpinejs} is a popular solution (number 13 this year).

At three, Svelte popularity keeps growing. It's often seen as a modern alternative ot React.
The biggest change in 2023 is the introduction of [runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes) in Svelte 5 (now in preview) to handle state reactivity.

It has its meta framework too, called {svelte-kit} whose v2 is expected very soon.

One of the biggest buzzwords in 2023 was "signals", used by libraries like {solid} or {preact} to handle reactivity.
