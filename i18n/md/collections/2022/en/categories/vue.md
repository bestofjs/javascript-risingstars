This year we got many major updates of Vue. [Vue 2.7](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-2-7-naruto.html) brings the native Composition API support and `<script setup>` syntax back to Vue 2.

Making the transition to Vue 3 much smoother. [`<script setup>`](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html) became stable and generally available, and the new experimental ["Reactivity Transform"](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-transform.html) is right around the corner to enhance the DX even further. The team is also working on a new rendering strategy called "Vapor mode", inspired by Soild.js, which could make Vue even more performant on critical parts.

The stable releases of [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com) and [Vuetify 3](https://next.vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/) indicate that Vue's ecosystem is mature enough. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) multiplies during the year, and we see a lot of adoption from Vue users, from [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue), Nuxt, [Quasar](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar), [Astro](https://astro.build/) and many new frameworks. With the power of Vite, Vue users also got a much better testing/developing experience with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Histoire](https://histoire.dev/). We also see creative usage of Vue, like rendering a command line interface with [vue-termui](https://vue-termui.dev/).

What a year for the improvements of DX! Hope the community can find those tools boosting their workflows, and looking forward to seeing what's coming next!
