#### Overall winner: Bun 🏆

The trendiest project of the year is {bun}: a new JavaScript run time that is all about performance and great DX. Its popularity exploded this summer with the first Beta release: +20,000 stars on GitHub in one month, we have never seen such an explosion since we started tracking projects at Best of JS.

So what makes Bun special? Like {deno}, the overall winner 2 years ago, it provides first class support for TypeScript.

But Bun is not just a run time, it's also:

- a package manager (think Yarn, NPM, PNPM)
- a building tool (think Webpack, ESBuild, Parcel)
- a test runner
- ... and many other things!

So Bun can install your dependencies reading your package.json. Bun can also run your scripts. It does everything faster than anything else.

Bun is a fresh take on many aspects of the JavaScript eco-system with a focus of performance.

The most incredible thing about Bun is that its creator [Jarred Sumner](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner) implemented all those features from scratch, using a low level language called [Zig](https:://ziglang.org).

It prioritizes standard Web APIs like Fetch. It supports many of the Node.js APIs which makes it compatible with most of the NPM packages.

It may be not "production-ready" (lack of Windows support) yet but it's a very promising tool. Compared to {deno} the eco-system is pretty new but it has already a web framework called [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) that claims to be the fastest HTTP framework.

#### Tauri

Fifth in 2021, {tauri} was even more popular in 2022 with 30,000 new stargazers.
It's a project written in Rust to create cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies.

The [version 1.0](https://tauri.app/blog/2022/06/19/tauri-1-0) was released in June.

It's built with security and performance in mind. Compared to {electron}, it has a small footprint as the developer has to specify the API and capabilities required by the application.

#### React and Next.js

At forth and fifth {react} and {nextjs} got similar numbers, with almost 20,000 new stargazers.

[Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13), released in October, leverages the [React Server Components](https://www.plasmic.app/blog/how-react-server-components-work#what-are-react-server-components) introduced by React 17 in 2020.

Andrew Clark, one of the maintainers of React made a bold statement about their adoption in the future in [this thread](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1585029529361612801):

> Server Components is the future of React and our goal is to spread this architecture to the entire React ecosystem, regardless of framework

#### Vite

At fifth {vite} is the trendiest tool to build applications based on web technologies while providing an amazing developer experience.

It had two major releases this year ([v3 in July](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite3.html) and [v4 in December](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite4.html)).

It powers more and more projects including the frameworks {sveltekit} and {qwik} and the test runner {vitest}.
