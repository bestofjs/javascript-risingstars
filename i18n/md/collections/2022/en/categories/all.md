The trendiest project of the year is {bun} a new JavaScript run time that is all about performance and great DX. Its popularity exploded this summer with the first Beta release: +20,000 stars on GitHub in one month, we have never seen such an explosion since we track projects in _Best of JS_.

So what makes Bun special? Like {deno}, the overall winner 2 years ago, it provides first class support for TypeScript.

But Bun is not just a run time, it's also:

- a package manager (think Yarn, NPM, PNPM)
- a building tool (think Webpack, ESBuild, Parcel)
- a test runner
- ... and many other things!

So Bun can install your dependencies reading your package.json. Bun can also run your scripts. It does everything faster than anything else.

Bun is a fresh take on many aspects of the JavaScript eco-system with a focus of performance.

The most incredible thing about Bun is that its creator [Jarred Sumner](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner) implemented all those features from scratch, using a low level language called [Zig](https:://ziglang.org).

It prioritizes standard Web APIs like Fetch. It supports many of the Node.js API which makes it compatible with most of the NPM packages.

It may be not "production-ready" (lack of Windows support) yet but it's a very promising tool.
