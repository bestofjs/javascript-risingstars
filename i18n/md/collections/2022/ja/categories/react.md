2022 saw React become more opinionated.

React is still a library that can be sprinkled into any webpage, but it’s also evolved into an architecture frameworks can follow to create interactive, resilient, and performance frontend patterns.

The React 18 release (in March) included concurrent features and APIs largely providing architecture patterns for frameworks. Consider [React Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components), designed to be implemented in conjunction with these new architecture patterns. Some conventions have now been standardized between React frameworks (e.g. [use client](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/227)) and others are being incubated (e.g. [async/await in Server Components](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/229)) during [beta periods](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#new-app-directory-beta).

In 2023, we’ll continue to see innovations using React’s new primitives, but also in the larger React ecosystem. The growth of libraries for improved type safety, as well as UI components, will continue to rise.
