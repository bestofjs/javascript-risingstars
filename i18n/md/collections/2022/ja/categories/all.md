#### Overall winner: Bun 🏆

The trendiest project of the year is {bun}: a new JavaScript runtime that is all about performance and great DX. Its popularity exploded this summer with the first Beta release: +20,000 stars on GitHub in one month. We have never seen such an explosion since we started tracking projects at Best of JS.

So what makes Bun special? Like {deno}, the overall winner two years ago, it provides first-class support for TypeScript.

But Bun is not just a runtime. It's also:

- a package manager (think Yarn, NPM, PNPM)
- a building tool (think Webpack, ESBuild, Parcel)
- a test runner
- ... and many other things!

So Bun can install your dependencies reading your package.json. Bun can also run your scripts. It does everything faster than anything else.

Bun is a fresh take on many aspects of the JavaScript ecosystem, focusing on performance.

It prioritizes standard Web APIs like Fetch. It supports many of the Node.js APIs, making it compatible with most NPM packages.
It may not be "production-ready" (lack of Windows support) yet, but it's a very promising tool. Compared to Deno, the ecosystem is pretty new, but it already has a web framework called [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/)  that claims to be the fastest HTTP framework.

The most incredible thing about Bun is that its creator, [Jarred Sumner](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner) implemented all those features from scratch using a low-level language called [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

#### Tauri

In fifth in 2021, {tauri} was even more popular in 2022 with 30,000 new stargazers.
It's a project written in Rust to create cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies.

The [version 1.0](https://tauri.app/blog/2022/06/19/tauri-1-0) was released in June.

It's built with security and performance in mind. Compared to {electron}, it has a small footprint as the developer has to specify the API and capabilities required by the application.

#### React and Next.js

In third and forth {react} and {nextjs} got similar numbers, with almost 20,000 new stargazers.

[Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13), released in October, leverages the [React Server Components](https://www.plasmic.app/blog/how-react-server-components-work#what-are-react-server-components) introduced by React 17 in 2020.

Andrew Clark, one of the maintainers of React made a bold statement about their adoption in the future in [this thread](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1585029529361612801):

> Server Components is the future of React and our goal is to spread this architecture to the entire React ecosystem, regardless of framework

#### Vite

In fifth {vite} is the trendiest tool to build applications based on web technologies while providing an amazing developer experience.

It had two major releases this year ([v3 in July](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite3.html) and [v4 in December](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite4.html)).

It powers more and more projects including the frameworks {sveltekit} and {qwik} and the test runner {vitest}.
